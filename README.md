# sipgate.io Node.js send fax example

To demonstrate how to send an Fax, we queried the `/sessions/fax` endpoint of the sipgate REST API.

For further information regarding the sipgate REST API please visit https://api.sipgate.com/v2/doc

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 10.15.3

### How To Use

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
In the [config.json](./config.json) file located in the project root directory insert `YOUR_SIPGATE_USERNAME`, `YOUR_SIPGATE_PASSWORD`, and `YOUR_SIPGATE_FAXLINE_EXTENSION`:

```json
...
"username": "YOUR_SIPGATE_USERNAME",
"password": "YOUR_SIPGATE_PASSWORD",
"faxlineId": "YOUR_SIPGATE_FAXLINE_EXTENSION",
...
```
The `faxlineId` uniquely identifies the extension from which you wish to send your Fax. Further explanation is given in the section [Fax Extensions](#fax-extensions).

Run the application:

```bash
node index.js <RECIPIENT> <PDF_DOCUMENT>
```

## How It Works

In our main script, the index.js, we check that the user provides the recipient phone number and a PDF document as an argument.
```javascript
if (process.argv.length < 4) {
	console.error('Please pass the recipient number and the path to the PDF as arguments!');
	console.log('node index.js RECIPIENT_NUMBER PDF_DOCUMENT');
	process.exit(1);
}

const recipientNumber = process.argv[2];
const filePath = process.argv[3];

const type = fileType(fs.readFileSync(filePath));

if (!type || type.mime !== 'application/pdf') {
	console.error('The file must be a PDF');
	process.exit(1);
}
```

To check if the provided file is a PDF document we use the `file-type` module to ensure that the mime-type of the file is `application/pdf`.

After getting the recipient number and filePath from the supplied arguments and checking the file is a PDF document, we call our `sendFax` function located in the [fax.js](./fax.js) and pass the `recipient` and the `filePath` as arguments.
```javascript
const sendFaxResponse = await sendFax(recipient, filePath);
```

In the `sendFax` function, we first get the filename of the supplied file.
```javascript
const filename = path.basename(filePath);
const base64Content = readFileAsBase64(filePath);
```

After that we call our `readFileAsBase64` function which reads the file contents and Base64 encodes it.
```javascript
const readFileAsBase64 = filePath => {
	const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
	return Buffer.from(fileContents).toString('base64');
};
```

We define the data object which contains the `faxlineId`, `recipient`, `filename`, and `base64Content`.
```javascript
const data = {
	faxlineId,
	recipient,
	filename,
	base64Content,
};
```


We use the axios package for request execution. The
`requestOptions` object contains the parameters `method`, `headers`, `auth`, `baseURL` and `data` (previously referred) which will be used by axios in order to send the desired http post request. The `auth` property takes a username and password and generates an HTTP Basic Auth header (for more information on Basic Auth see our [code example](https://github.com/sipgate/sipgateio-basicauth-node)).
```javascript
...
const requestOptions = {
	baseURL: baseUrl,
	method: 'POST',
	headers: {
		Accept: 'application/json',
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
	},
	auth: {
		username,
		password,
	},
	data,
};

try {
	const sendFaxResponse = await axios(`/sessions/fax`, requestOptions);
	return sendFaxResponse;
} catch (error) {
	console.error('Error:', error.message);
	return null;
}
...
```
The `axios` instance takes the request URL and `requestOptions` as arguments and process the desired http request. The request URL consists of the base URL defined above and the endpoint `/sessions/fax`.

Next we check if status of our `sendFaxResponse` is 200, meaning that the request to send the fax was successfully received.
**Note:** Although the Api returns the status 200 it does not mean that the fax was sent. It was only added to a queue for sending.

To check the status of the fax we use the `sessionId`, returned by the `sendFax` function, and pass it to the `fetchFaxStatus` function. In this example we use `setInterval` to check the status of the fax every five seconds.
```javascript

if (sendFaxResponse && sendFaxResponse.status === 200) {
	console.log('Fax added to the sending queue.');

	
	const { sessionId } = sendFaxResponse.data;

	setInterval(async () => {
		const faxStatus = await fetchFaxStatus(sessionId);

		if (faxStatus) {
			console.log('Checking fax status -', new Date());
			console.log(faxStatus);

			if (faxStatus.faxStatusType === 'SENT') {
				console.log('The Fax was sent successfully.');
				process.exit(1);
			}
		} else {
			console.error('Could not get fax status.');
			process.exit(1);
		}
	}, 5000);
}
```

In the `fetchFaxStatus` function we use axios again to query the `/history/{sessionId}` endpoint to get the history entry for our fax. In this case we are only interested in the `faxStatusType`.
```javascript
const fetchFaxStatus = async sessionId => {
	try {
		const historyResponse = await axios(`/history/${sessionId}`, {
			baseURL: baseUrl,
			method: 'GET',
			headers: {
				Accept: 'application/json',
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
			auth: {
				username,
				password,
			},
		});
		return {
			faxStatusType: historyResponse.data.faxStatusType,
		};
	} catch (error) {
		console.error('Error:', error.message);
		return null;
	}
};
```

The `faxStatusType` can contain the following values:
- `PENDING`: The fax was added to the queue for sending, but the sending process has not started yet
- `SENDING`: The fax is currently being sent
- `FAILED`: The fax could not be sent
- `SENT`: The fax was sent successfully
- `SCHEDULED`: The fax is scheduled for sending at the specified timestamp (it is not `PENDING` because it is not waiting in the queue of faxes to be sent yet)









### Fax Extensions

A Fax extension consists of the letter 'f' followed by a number (e.g. 'f0'). The sipgate API uses the concept of Fax extensions to identify devices within your account that are enabled to send Fax. In this context the term 'device' does not necessarily refer to a hardware Fax but rather a virtual representation.

You can find out what your extension is as follows:

1. Log into your [sipgate account](https://app.sipgate.com/w0/connections)
2. Use the sidebar to navigate to the **Connections** (_Anschl√ºsse_) tab
3. Click **Fax** 
4. The URL of the page should have the form `https://app.sipgate.com/{...}/connections/faxlines/{faxlineId}` where `{faxlineId}` is your Fax extension.

### Common Issues

#### Fax added to the sending queue, but sending failed

Possible reasons are:

- PDF file not encoded correctly in base64
- PDF file with text fields or forms are not supported
- PDF file is corrupt

#### HTTP Errors
